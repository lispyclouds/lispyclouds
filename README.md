## Heyo! ðŸ‘‹

I am primarily an [SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_reliability_engineering) dedicated to making simpler tools to bridge the gap between Dev and Ops. As a die hard [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) fan, I am fascinated to use its power and simplicity to make infra simple too; a place where it is rarely seen but can be of immense value.

Mostly based in London, UK, I love to organise and attend meetups and conferences around increasing diversity in tech, [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and food. I am always up for a (often emotional) discussion about [<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5615588/219205995-8750a6eb-9486-4c1b-b4cb-ce28ad1d1c72.png" alt="demisexuality" width="22" height="14">](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demisexuality), [veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism), [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), [anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism), ways to increase diversity and getting rid of static [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) altogether (except [ML Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system), keep [TJ DeVries](https://github.com/tjdevries) happy!).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on how not to write more code and make fusion cusine
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on increasing diversity in tech and specially open source
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. Since I am not you, I will learn something from you too! ðŸ¤—
