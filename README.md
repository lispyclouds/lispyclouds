## Heyo! ðŸ‘‹

I am an Infrastructure Consultant at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) dedicated to making simpler tools to bridge the gap between Dev and Ops. As a die hard [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) fan, I am fascinated to use its power and simplicity to make infra simple too; a place where it is rarely seen but can be of immense value.

Mostly based in Berlin, I love to organise and attend meetups and conferences around increasing diversity in tech, [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and food. I am always up for a (often emotional) discussion about [veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism), [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change), [anarcho-communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism), ways to increase diversity and getting rid of static [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) altogether.
